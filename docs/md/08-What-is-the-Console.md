I can imagine a question in your mind: **How does this code in `main.js` ...**
```javascript
console.log("Hello World")
```
**... plus this command in the Terminal...**

```bash-w
node main.js
```
**... make this text appear in the Terminal?**

```bash-w
Hello World!
```

## The console and `console.log()`
In NodeJS, "[console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console)" is how JavaScript refers to the Terminal where the current script is running. (Later, you'll see that browsers also have a Console, which behaves very like the Terminal.)

## Objects and methods

`console` is a _global object_. The word “object” has a special meaning in programming. An object can have methods and properties. As you will see, JavaScript is built with objects. And because it is global, console can be used anywhere in your project.

A method is something an object can do. A property is something it has. It doesn't have to have any methods or properties. If you think of a method like a human being:

* It can be like a new-born baby, who can cry but has no possessions yet. (It has methods but no properties)
* It can be like a reclusive miser, who has many possessions but does nothing with them. (It has properties, but no methods)
* It can be like a regular person, who has stuff and does stuff.


The `console` has several methods but no properties. (It's like a house elf. It doesn't need any possessions.)

In this project, you will use the following methods:

| method | action |
| ------ | ------ |
| `console.log()` | prints the parameters in the Terminal, with a space between each parameter |
| `console.clear()` | removes all text from the Terminal |

## Parameters

The data inside the round parentheses (`( ... )`) is called a _parameter_. In this case `"Hello World!"` is the only parameter.

<summary>Showing text in the Terminal</summary>
You'll be using `console.log()` several times in your project, to show text in the Terminal.

As you'll discover, it can also be used to _hide_ text, but not many people know this. (You don't have to keep it a secret.)
