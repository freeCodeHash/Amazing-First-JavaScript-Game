If the AI is not ready to play yet, you can focus on creating an activity for a solo player. Below is a list of  challenges for you.

I'll treat each one in a separate section.
  
### 1. After the nail is hit, can you show it at its new length?
  
```bash-w
-===========| The nail is 12 units long.

[1] gently
[2] firmly
[3] hard
[0] CANCEL

How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: 3
-========|
```

### 2. Can you show how hard the solo player hits the nail?

```bash-w
-===========| The nail is 12 units long.

[1] gently
[2] firmly
[3] hard
[0] CANCEL

How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: 2
-=========| You hit the nail firmly.
```

### 3. Can you remove the question after it is answered?

```bash-w
-===========| The nail is 12 units long.
