As you saw in the last section [27. Redrawing the Nail](#redrawing-the-nail), each challenge has three parts:

1. The task to complete
2. Hints on how to think about solving it
3. The complete code of the game with the solution included

The changes are just a few lines each time, but they might be in different places in the code.

### You won't learn much if you simply copy and paste the (changed lines of) code.

If you get stuck, a better approach is to:

* Study the changed lines of code in the Solution
* Hide the solution
* Edit your own code from memory

If you understand how the changed lines work, it should be easy to reproduce them.

### If you don't understand the changed lines, do some research.

There are different ways to do this:

1. In your browser, create a query for `js ...` followed by the keywords in the code that you don't understand
2. Look at different articles until you find one that make everything clear for you
3. Run tests in separate .js files or in the Node IDE, using examples from the articles that you read
4. Do your best to predict what the outcome of each test will be, and review your understanding if your prediction is wrong.

<summary>`js`, or searching online for “JavaScript”</summary>
In the Google search query I used above, I wrote `js` and not `JavaScript`. There are many many JavaScript programmers who work for search-engine companies, and they all like to type as little as possible. As a result, their algorithms understand that the extension `js` refers to JavaScript, and you don’t have to type the full name each time you make a query.

### Learning anything feels awkward

Whenever you learn something new, like playing a musical instrument, touch-typing, driving a car, moon-walking, cooking an egg, playing basketball, or whatever, you have to focus and think actively about what order to make what move. As the skill becomes familiar to you, your brain develops pathways for your thoughts to follow, without you being conscious of them.

Learning to be a developer is no different. When you start, you keep having to look at your notes and the instructions you are following, the concepts you are learning seem strange and arbitrary and disconnected, you feel that the process should be easier.

Just remember that even when you were learning to walk, you kept falling and kept getting up. And finally, you were able to reach the cookie jar all by yourself.

### If you think you have correctly altered your code, but it doesn't work as expected, compare your code with mine.

1. Open the Solution
2. Use the Copy button at the top left of a code listing to copy the complete code

3. Open your `main.js` file in VS code
4. Press the `F1` key on your keyboard (or `Ctrl-Shift-P`) to open the Command Palette
5. Start typing the beginning of the text `Compare Active File with Clipboard`

![Select `Compare Active File with Clipboard` in the Command Palette](images/compare.webp)

6. A new document will open called `Clipboard ⇔ main.js`. Depending on the width your VS Code window, the differences may be shown inline...

   ... or side-by-side:

### Embrace your mistakes

If you get everything right the first time, then your brain has not had to work very hard, so it's not going to make the effort to remember. 

If you make a mistake, you will feel some kind of emotion. Research shows that your [memory is triggered by emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_and_memory).

["Experience is making mistakes and learning from them.”](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/bill_ackman_666894)

In other words: making mistakes is one of the keys to learning.
