As [Matt Parker explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg&t=291s), the winning strategy is to leave a multiple of 4 units when you complete your turn. His Dr Nim game [will always play only one marble]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg&t=531s)) if it is in a losing position.

This is a good strategy when playing against a human who doesn't understand the system, because the human has more marbles to make a mistake with. It's certainly the easiest strategy for a piece of plastic to use.

<summary>Challenge 3: Can you get the AI to play a smart legal move?</summary>
The AI must choose a value for `force` between `1` and `3`, but it can't always choose to play `length % 4`. If `length % 4` is 0, you can make the AI hit the nail gently (the equivalent of Dr Nim taking only one marble), so that the nail only becomes one unit shorter.

Here the AI starts in a losing position, so it plays gently:

```bash-w
<i>-===========| The nail is 12 units long.

</i><b>===========|  I hit the nail gently.</b>
```

But if the human player makes a mistake, the AI seizes the opportunity to win.

```bash-w
</i>==========|    You hit the nail gently.

</i><b>========|     I hit the nail firmly.</b>
```

After the AI's turn, the number of units left is a multiple of four. Whatever the human player does, the AI can play to restore a multiple of four:

```bash-w
<i>=====|        You hit the nail hard.

</i><b>====|         I hit the nail gently.</b>
```

After any move the human player can make, the AI is sure to win:

```bash-w
<i>[1] gently
[2] firmly
[3] hard
[0] CANCEL</i>

How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: </i>
```

<details class="hint">
<summary>Hints</summary>
1. You've tested something like `length % 4` in the Node IDE. Would this be useful here?
2. How do you prevent the AI from using `0` for `force`?
3. You've already seen `Math.min()` in this line of code:

   ```javascript
   force = Math.min(index + 1, length)
   ```
   
   You used this to make sure that `force` never became more    than was necessary to win, so that the text for the last hit    was properly aligned.
   
   It won't be a surprise that JavaScript also gives you [Math.   max()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/   JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max)

4. You want to make sure that the value of `force` used by the AI is always at least `1`
5. You'll need to set `index` to `force - 1`, so that the correct value from the `strengths` array is used for the AI

<summary>Solution</summary>

There are only two lines that you need to **change**.

```javascript-
<i>const {
  keyInYN,
  keyInSelect
} = require('readline-sync')

const rules = `Let's knock a nail into this computer!

* Each player takes a turn to hit the nail once.
* A player can hit the nail in one of three ways:
  gently, firmly, hard.
* Depending on the force used, the nail will be
  driven more or less deeply into the Terminal.
* The player who knocks the nail all the way in
  is the winner.

Are you ready?
`
const whoStarts = `If you want to start, type Y.
If you want me to start press any other key. `
const nailIs    = "The nail is "
const long      = " units long."
const clear     = "\x1B[1A\x1B[K"
const strength  = [
  'gently',
  'firmly',
  'hard'
]
const question = 'How hard do you plan to hit?'
const players  = [ "I", "You" ]
const hit      = " hit the nail "
const win      = `
You win!
`
const endGame  = `Thanks for playing!
`

const initial = 12 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)
let length    = initial
let toDelete  = 14
let prompt    = nailIs + length + long
let started   = false
let index
let force
let nail

console.log(rules)
let player = keyInYN(whoStarts)

while (length > 0) {
  if (!started) {
    nail = "-" + "=".repeat(length - 1) + "|"
  } else {
    nail = "=".repeat(length) + "|"
  }

  console.log(clear.repeat(toDelete))
  console.log(nail, prompt)

  if (player) { // it's the human player's turn
    index = keyInSelect(strength, question)
    if (index < 0) {
      console.log(clear.repeat(toDelete))
      console.log(endGame)
      process.exit()
    }

    force = Math.min(index + 1, length)
    toDelete = 7
  } else { // it's the AI's turn to play
    toDelete = 0
    </i><b>force = Math.max(1, length % 4)
    index = force - 1</b><i>
  }

  prompt = " ".repeat(initial - length + force)
         + players[player + 0] + hit + strength[index] + "."

  length = length - force
  started = true
  player = !player
}

console.log(clear.repeat(toDelete))
console.log("|", prompt)
console.log(win)</i>
```
