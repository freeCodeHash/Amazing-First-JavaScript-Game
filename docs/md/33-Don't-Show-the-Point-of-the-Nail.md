<summary>Challenge 6. Can you show the point of the nail only at the start?</summary>
After the first hit, the point of the nail be hidden. Here’s how the nail could be drawn more realistically:

```bash-w
<i>-===========|  The nail is 12 units long.

</i><b>=========|</b><i>  You hit the nail hard.

</i><b>=======|</b><i>  You hit the nail firmly.

</i><b>====|</b><i>  You hit the nail hard.

</i><b>==|</b><i>  You hit the nail firmly.

</i><b>=|</b><i>  You hit the nail gently.

| You hit the nail firmly.

You win!</i>
```

<summary>Hints</summary>
1. To solve this problem, you will need to tell JavaScript if a player has already chosen a value for `force`
2. You can create a new variable with `let` to hold this information
3. You could call your variable `started`, and give it the value `false` before the game begins
4. You can set `started` to `true` after the `if () {} else {}` statement, when you can be sure that one of the players will have chosen a value for `force`
5. You can create your own `if () {} else {}` statement to draw the nail with a point (`-`) if the game is not started, or without a point (only `=` characters) if the game has started.
6. You can use the [logical not operator (`!`)](https://hashnode.com/draft/logical%20not%20operator%20(%3Ccode%3E!%3C/code%3E)https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_NOT) to check if the game is not started.

<summary>Solution</summary>

There are six **changed** lines in the solution below.

```javascript-
<i>const {
  keyInYN,
  keyInSelect
} = require('readline-sync')

const rules = `Let's knock a nail into this computer!

* Each player takes a turn to hit the nail once.
* A player can hit the nail in one of three ways:
  gently, firmly, hard.
* Depending on the force used, the nail will be
  driven more or less deeply into the Terminal.
* The player who knocks the nail all the way in
  is the winner.

Are you ready?
`
const whoStarts = `If you want to start, type Y.
If you want me to start press any other key. `
const nailIs    = "The nail is "
const long      = " units long."
const clear     = "\x1B[1A\x1B[K"
const strength  = [
  'gently',
  'firmly',
  'hard'
]
const question = 'How hard do you plan to hit?'
const hit      = "You hit the nail "
const win      = `
You win!
`
