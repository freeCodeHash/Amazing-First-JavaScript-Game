<summary>Challenge 9: Can you stop the game early, before anyone wins?</summary>

If the human player presses `0` when asked how hard to hit, can you make the game end gracefully?

```bash-w
<i>-==============| The nail is 15 units long.

============|    You hit the nail hard.

[1] gently
[2] firmly
[3] hard
[0] CANCEL

How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: </i> <b>0

Thanks for playing!</b>
```

1. You can add a `const` variable called `endGame` with the text that you want to show when the game ends.
2. You can check if `index < 0` in the `if` statement for the player.
3. If so, you can `console.log(endGame)` and then call `process.exit()`
4. It might be tidier to remove the question that the player just decided not to answer.

There are seven **new lines** in two different places.

```javascript-
<i>const {
  keyInYN,
  keyInSelect
} = require('readline-sync')

const rules = `Let's knock a nail into this computer!

* Each player takes a turn to hit the nail once.
* A player can hit the nail in one of three ways:
  gently, firmly, hard.
* Depending on the force used, the nail will be
  driven more or less deeply into the Terminal.
* The player who knocks the nail all the way in
  is the winner.

Are you ready?
`
const whoStarts = `If you want to start, type Y.
If you want me to start press any other key. `
const nailIs    = "The nail is "
const long      = " units long."
