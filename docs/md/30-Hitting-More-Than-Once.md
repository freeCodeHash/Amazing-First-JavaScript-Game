<summary>Challenge 4: Can you let the solo player hit the nail several times?</summary>
This challenge is more tricky. I expect that you will see a number of errors as you work on it, so I will walk you through it. Fixing these errors will also resolve the WET issue (We Enjoy Typing - the opposite of DRY).

Here's the display in the Terminal that you are aiming for:

```bash-w
<i>-===========| The nail is 12 units long.

-========| You hit the nail hard.</i>

<b>-======| You hit the nail firmly.

-=====| You hit the nail gently.

-===| You hit the nail firmly.

-| You hit the nail hard.</b>
```

</details>

## Repetition with `while`

In section [20: Never Repeat a Trick](#never-repeat-a-trick), you wrote a script called `while.js`, which logged `Nail length: ` from 12 down to 1.

```javascript
let length = 12
while (length) {
  console.log("Nail length: " + length)
  length = length - 1
}
console.log("length:", length)
```

You can use a similar technique here.

1. In `main.js`, you can wrap the `if` statement that checks if the player is human or AI in a `while` loop:

```javascript-#37
<i>console.log(rules)
let player = keyInYN(whoStarts)
console.log(clear.repeat(toDelete))
console.log(nail, prompt)</i>

<b>while (length) {</b>
  <i>if (player) { // it's the human player's turn
    const index = keyInSelect(strength, question)
    force = index + 1
    prompt = hit + strength[index] + "."
    toDelete = 7
  } else { // it's the AI's turn to play
    console.log(`The AI is not ready yet.
  You'll have to play solo.`)
    player = true
    force = 0
  }

  length = length - force
  nail   = "-" + "=".repeat(length - 1) + "|"
  console.log(clear.repeat(toDelete))
  console.log(nail, prompt)</i>
<b>}</b>
```

2. In the Terminal, run:

```bash-w
node main.js
```

3. Press `Y` to choose to start.
4. Press a number from `1` to `3` each time you are asked.

To begin with, all will be well, but finally you will get an error:

<details class="warn" open>
<summary>Invalid count value: -1</summary>
```bash-w
<i>-===========| The nail is 12 units long.

-========| You hit the nail hard.

-======| You hit the nail firmly.

-=====| You hit the nail gently.

-===| You hit the nail firmly.

-| You hit the nail hard.</i>

## The debugger to the rescue!

It might be helpful to use VS Code's debugger to see what the problem is.

1. Press the `F5` shortcut (or use the menu item Run > Start Debugging if you have the time, and no-one's looking)
2. As before, select Node.js in the Command Palette when asked which language you want to debug.

![Select the debugger for Node.js](images/SelectNodeJS.webp)

3. Open the Debug Console.
4. Yikes!

![The current environment doesn't support interactive reading from TTY](images/unsupported.webp)

Here's an extract of the error message. It shows that the error occurred on line 38 of `main.js`.

<details class="trouble" open>
<summary>environment doesn't support interactive reading from TTY</summary>
```bash-w
opt/homebrew/bin/node ./main.js
Let's knock a nail into this computer!

* Each player takes a turn to hit the nail once.
* A player can hit the nail in one of three ways:
  gently, firmly, hard.
* Depending on the force used, the nail will be
  driven more or less deeply into the Terminal.
* The player who knocks the nail all the way in
  is the winner.

Are you ready?

</details>

Here is line 38 of `main.js`:

```javascript-#38
let player = keyInYN(whoStarts)
```

This is the line where `readline-sync` is used for the first time.

**In other words, the error occurred because VS Code's debugger doesn't work with `readline-sync`.**

The debugger is designed to work with Node.js and JavaScript. `readline-sync` interacts with the Terminal. Out of the box, they are incompatible.

But you can guess that if I suggested that you use the debugger, there will be a solution. The question is: How to find the solution?

Google is your friend. The problem you have just met is due to the interaction between three things: VS Code, `readline-sync` and the debugger. Here's a Google query for exactly these three things:

[vs code readline-sync debugger](https://www.google.com/search?q=vs+code+readline-sync+debugger)

1. Click on the link above.

![Using Google to search for solutions](images/askingGoogle.webp)

In my browser, the first link that Google gives is to a question on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).

</details>

If I visit this stackoverflow link, I find that the question does not exactly match my problem. But I'm interested in answers.

1. Scroll down until you find [Muneeb's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66850526/1927589)

![Muneeb's answer](images/MuneebAnswer.webp)

**"Well that's very nice. An answer with 10 reputation points,"** you think. **"But what's a `launch.json` file? And where do I put this line `"console": "integratedTerminal"`?"**

3. Look at the VS Code window where your error is showing.
4. Make sure the Run panel is showing (menu View > Run, Shift-Ctrl-D (for _Debug_), or click on the Run and Debug icon).

![The 'create a launch.json file' link](images/createLaunchJSON.webp)

5. Look for the link to `create a launch.json file`, and click on it.

![Composite image: creating the `launch.json` file](images/launchJSON.webp)

VS Code will create a new file at `Nail_It/.vscode/launch.json`. This will tell VS Code that, in the future, when you run the debugger, you want `node` to `launch` the file at `"${workspaceFolder}/main.js"` and not to bother you with any code written in `node_internals`.

This is the file where you can add the line `"console": "integratedTerminal"`:

```json
<i>{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
      ],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.js"</i><b>,
      "console": "integratedTerminal"</b><i>
    }
  ]
}</i>
```
6. Add the line suggested by Muneeb to your new `launch.json` file.
7. Be sure to place a comma (`,`) at the end of the previous line.
8. Press `F5` again, to start the debugger.

![The debugger doesn't complain now](images/debuggingWithReadlineSync.webp)

This time everything works fine. The Terminal explains to you how helpful it is being, and then it runs your script.

## Add a breakpoint

The debugger might not want to let you add a breakpoint while it is running.

1. Stop the debugger by pressing `Shift-F5`, or clicking on the little red square in the Control Panel.

![The Stop button in the Control Panel](images/stopButton.webp)

2. Check the first error you got, before you ran the debugger, to see where the error occurred:

```bash-w
RangeError: Invalid count value: -1
    at String.repeat (<anonymous>)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/path/to/My Learning Journey/Nail_It/<b>main.js:56:25</b>)
```

3. Put a debug breakpoint on line 56 of your `main.js` script:

![Add a breakpoint to line 56](images/breakpoint56.png)

4. Press the `F5` key to start debugging. Your game will ask you to press `Y` and then choose a number from 1 - 3.

5. Press `3` on your keyboard.

   The debugger will stop on line 56, before it executes that line.

   ![Going through first pass off the `while` loop with the debugger](images/debugFirstPass.webp)

   You can see that the value of `force` has been set to `3`, and that `length` has been updated to `9`. The value of `nail` is still exactly what you code calculated on line 33. The nail is still 12 units long.

6. Click on the Step Over button in the Command Palette, or press the `F10` shortcut.

   ![The value for `nail` is updated when you activate Step Over](images/updateNail.webp)

   JavaScript has no problem creating a new string for `nail`.

7. Activate Step Over two more times.

   ![The question is cleared and the nail is redrawn](images/redrawTheNail.webp)
   
   Three things will happen:
   
   * The question will be cleared from the Terminal
   * A new, shorter version of the nail will be drawn
   * The debugger will jump back to the beginning of the `while` loop

8. Activate Step Over three more times. The debugger will step back into the `while` loop, because `length` is `9` and non-zero numbers are truthy. But on the third step, the debugger will stop showing which line is about to be executed and it will stop showing any variables.

   ![The debugger takes a break while readline-sync is active](images/readlineSyncIsActive.webp)

   This is because the `keyInSelect()` method of `readline-sync` has taken control. It's busy listening for your input in the Terminal.

9. Click on the Terminal to activate it.
10. On your keyboard, press a number from 1 - 3.

    ![The debugger becomes active again after `keyInSelect()` returns a value](images/debuggerActiveAgain.webp)

    The debugger becomes active again.

    **Note that there is an entry for `index` in the `Block` section of the VARIABLES pane.** (The value `this` is there for house-keeping reasons.)

11. Press the Continue button in the Control Panel, or press the shortcut key `F5`.
    
    The debugger will jump directly to line 56, executing all the code on the way. 

12. In the WATCH panel, click on the `+` button and enter the expression `length - 1`.

    ![Using the WATCH panel to watch the value of an expression](images/watchLength-1.webp)

    You should see that its value is `5`. Again, JavaScript will have no problem creating a new string for `nail`.

13. Press `F5` to make your script continue running.
14. Activate the Terminal, and press the `3` key on your keyboard
15. Repeat steps 13 and 14 again.

Now you can see the problem. In the WATCH panel, you can see that `length - 1 = -1`. The [string method `.repeat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeat) can't handle negative numbers.

![Debugging the `while` loop](images/DebuggingTheLoop.webp)

<details class="question" open>
<summary>Where has `index` gone?</summary>
In the VARIABLES pane of the debugger, there is no entry for `index`. Why not?

The debugger is paused on line 56, which is outside the curly-bracket code block where `index` is declared. At this point in the code JavaScript and the debugger have forgotten that `index` ever existed.

</details>

16. Just for closure, activate Step Over one last time.

![Your game exits with an error](images/debuggerDisconnect.webp)

<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>How to fix this?</summary>
The debugger disconnects and JavaScript shows the same error it gave you before:

```bash-w
Invalid count value: -1 ... /Nail_It/main.js:56:25
```

This is the problem that you are going to have to fix, but the debugger has shown you how and where the error occurs.

Remember how I pointed out that there were problems with repeated lines of code? In the next section, you'll see how to make your code work without them.
